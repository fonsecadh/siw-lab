                <h2>What made his return possible?</h2>
                <p>Following his departure from Bolivia in November 2019, members of the right-wing interim government accused Mr Morales of sedition, terrorism and statutory rape.</p>
                <p>A judge issued an arrest warrant for the former leader, but last month that order was annulled, paving the way for him to return without fear of being detained.</p>
                <p>Mr Morales had long said that he would return to Bolivia if his socialist Mas party, which he continues to lead, won the re-run of the disputed 2019 election.</p>
