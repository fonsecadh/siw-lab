Bolivian ex-President Evo Morales returns from exile

The former president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, has crossed from Argentina into Bolivia almost a year after he went into exile.

Mr Morales resigned and left Bolivia in November 2019 amid mass protests over allegations of vote rigging in the presidential election.

He said he would return to Bolivia if his Mas party won the re-run of the election, which it did on 18 October.

The former president was received by hundreds of supporters at the border.

Mr Morales was Bolivia's first indigenous president and led the country for almost 14 years. 

What made his return possible?

Following his departure from Bolivia in November 2019, members of the right-wing interim government accused Mr Morales of sedition, terrorism and statutory rape.

A judge issued an arrest warrant for the former leader, but last month that order was annulled, paving the way for him to return without fear of being detained.

Mr Morales had long said that he would return to Bolivia if his socialist Mas party, which he continues to lead, won the re-run of the disputed 2019 election.

While Luis Arce, the candidate for the Mas party, had been leading in the polls, he surprised many observers by winning outright in the first round.
