	- experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a wing in a slipstream brenckman,m j ae scs 25, 1958, 324 experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a wing in a slipstream an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios the results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different theoretical treatments of this problem the comparative span loading curves, together with supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or boundary-layer-control effect the integrated remaining lift increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree well with a potential flow theory an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for the specific configuration of the experiment 
	- 	pressure measurements on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half-angle cones at mach number 3 6 and angles of attack to 100 amick,j nasa tn 753, 1961 pressure measurements on sharp and blunt 5 and 15 half-angle cones at mach number 3 6 and angles of attack to 100 measured pressure distributions on cones are compared with modified newtonian theory deviations as large as 14 percent of the stagnation pressure behind a normal shock are found by combining empirical results for cylinders normal to the flow with newtonian concepts, a method of calculating pressures on cones at high angles of attack is developed calculations by this method differ from the experimental results on sharp cones by only 2 percent of the stagnation pressure behind a normal shock for blunted cones, additional deviations up to 8 percent are noted near the nose schlieren pictures of the flow show an attached shock on the sharp of attack detachment of the shock appears to be associated with the attainment of sonic speed immediately behind the shock an orifice size effect is found which can increase the indicated pressure above the true value, if the orifice width is greater than one-tenth the local radius of curvature 
	- 	theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm adams,e nasa tn 564, 1961 theoretical investigation of the ablation of a glass-type heat protection shield of varied material properties at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm the melting-type heat protection at the stagnation point of a re-entering irbm is treated by employing homogeneous, opaque, and nondecomposing glass shields which do not exceed a temperature of some effects due to variations of the glass properties the ballistic re-entry vehicle has a nose diameter of 0 35 m, a ballistic factor of 3 x 10, a re-entry angle of 124 (from the vertical) at an altitude of 100 km, and a re-entry speed of 4 the performance of 36 different glass shields with assumed combinations of material properties is investigated by employing a calculation method which yields practically exact, transient solutions for the problem as a corollary, results for a certain steady flight state are also given the discussions made it possible to derive under realistic flight conditions some thermal characteristics for the employment of thin, or light-weight, glass shields investigation of these hypothetical glass shields leads to the conclusion that a low thermal conductivity and a high specific heat, and thus, a small thermal diffusivity are most desirable a small thermal diffusivity yields high surface temperatures, causing a high radiative heat transfer out of the shield, and steep temperature profiles normal to the surface, causing a small thermal penetration across the shield with little total ablation of the shield results show that for the assumed irbm re-entry, the necessary thickness of the employed glass shields increases monotonically with thermal diffusivity which is the only material parameter affecting this thickness a high viscosity level and a high emissivity constant of the surface of the supposedly opaque shield are also desirable, although, these two properties exert a comparatively small influence on the overall performance when disregarding glass shields with an extremely low viscosity level 
	-  	investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects of jet mach number and divergence angle of the nozzle upon the pressure of the base annulus of a body of revolution bromm,a and o'donnel,r naca rm l54i16, 1954 investigation at supersonic speeds of the effects of jet mach number and divergence angle of the nozzle upon the pressure of the base annulus of a body of revolution an investigation has been conducted in the langley 9-inch supersonic tunnel to determine the jet effects for varying jet mach number and nozzle divergence angle upon the pressure on the base annulus of a model with a cylindrical afterbody the tests were conducted over a wide range of jet static pressure ratios and at a reynolds number of approximately free-stream mach numbers of 1 2, 1 4, and 2 1 all testing was conducted with an artificially induced turbulent boundary layer along the model in the lower range of jet static pressure ratios, jet flow from a sonic or supersonic nozzle affected the pressure acting on the base annulus in essentially the same manner as shown in naca rm e53h25 which covers jet static pressure ratios up to about present results showed that the base pressure tends to level off with increasing jet static pressure ratio, and at the extreme static pressure ratios reached in tests with sonic nozzles the base pressure began to decrease except in the lower range of jet static pressure ratios, nozzle divergence angle generally had a larger effect on the base pressures than nozzle mach number, the increase in base pressure for a change in divergence angle from 0 to 10 was small compared to the increase when the divergence angle was changed from and other data indicates that the effects of divergence angle were reduced when the ratio of jet exit diameter to base diameter was decreased jet mach number effects increased with increase in stream mach number 
	-  	pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and including the transonic speed range swihart,j and whitcomb,c naca rm l53h04, 1953 pressure distributions on three bodies of revolution to determine the effect of reynolds number up to and including the transonic speed range this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range the effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is also included the models were tested through a mach number range from 0 0 to 1 9 the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x diameter was 1 x 10 to 4 3 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly these effects were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0 5 in the normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow reynolds number range this increase is in agreement with theoretical approximations a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the body the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a mach number of 1 5 at this mach number the effect was to cause a small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body

	-  	elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds jorgensen,l naca tn4045,1957 elliptic cones alone and with wings at supersonic speeds to help fill the gap in the knowledge of aerodynamics of shapes intermediate between bodies of revolution and flat triangular wings, force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones have been experimentally determined for mach numbers of 1 7 and sectional axis ratios from 1 through 6 and with lengths and base areas equal to circular cones of fineness ratios 3 7 and 5 have been studied for angles of bank of 0 and 90 elliptic and circular cones in combination with triangular wings of aspect ratios 1 and 1 also have been considered the angle-of-attack range was from 0 to about 16, and the reynolds number was 8x10, based on model length in addition to the forces and moments at angle of attack, pressure distributions for elliptic cones at zero angle of attack have been determined the results of this investigation indicate that there are distinct aerodynamic advantages to the use of elliptic cones with their major cross-sectional axes horizontal, they develop greater lift and have higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones of the same fineness ratio and volume in combination with triangular wings of low aspect ratio, they also develop higher lift-drag ratios than circular cones with the same wings for winged elliptic cones, this increase in lift-drag ratio results both from lower zero-lift drag and drag due to lift visual-flow studies indicate that, because of better streamlining in the crossflow plane, vortex flow is inhibited more for an elliptic cone with major axis in the plane of the wing than for a circular cone with the same wing as a result, vortex drag resulting from lift is reduced shifts in center of pressure with changes in angle of attack and mach number are small and about the same as for circular cones comparisons of theoretical and experimental force and moment characteristics for elliptic cones indicate that simple linearized (flat plate) wing theory is generally adequate even for relatively thick cones zero-lift pressure distributions and drag can be computed using van dyke's second-order slender-body theory for winged circular cones, a modification of the slender-body theory of naca rep 962 results in good agreement of theory with experiment 
	-  	practical calculation of second-order supersonic flow past non-lifting bodies of revolution van dyke,m naca tn 744 practical calculation of second-order supersonic flow past non-lifting bodies of revolution calculation of second-order supersonic flow past bodies of revolution at zero angle of attack is described in detail, and reduced to routine computation use of an approximate tangency condition is shown to increase the accuracy for bodies with corners tables of basic functions and standard computing forms are presented the procedure is summarized so that one can apply it without necessarily understanding the details of the theory a sample calculation is given, and several examples are compared with solutions calculated by the method of characteristics 
	-  	the effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidance requirements for the return lunar flight wong,t and slye,r nasa r-80, 1960 the effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidance requirements for the return lunar flight corridors for manned vehicles are defined consistent with requirements for avoiding radiation exposure and for limiting values of peak deceleration use of lift increases the depth of the entry corridor mid-course guidance requirements appear to be critical only for the flight-path angle increasing the energy of the transfer orbit increases the required guidance accuracy for the flight-path angle corrective thrust applied essentially parallel to the local horizontal produces the maximum change in perigee altitude for a given increment of velocity energy required to effect a given change in perigee altitude varies inversely with range measured from the center of the earth 
	-  	contributions of the wing panels to the forces and moments of supersonic wing-body combinations at combined angles spahr,j naca tn 146, 1958 contributions of the wing panels to the forces and moments of supersonic wing-body combinations at combined angles a wind-tunnel investigation was conducted at a mach number of 1 6 and at reynolds numbers (based on the mean aerodynamic chord of the exposed wing) of 0 6 and 1 3 million to determine the normal forces, pitching moments, and rolling moments contributed by each wing panel of a cruciform-wing and body combination over a wide range of combined angles of pitch and roll the wings were triangular of aspect ratio 2, and the body was an ogive-cylinder combination the effects of forebody length and roughness and of the presence of the adjacent panels on these panel contributions were determined the results of the investigation show that large changes in the panel forces and moments can occur as the result of combined angles a general theoretical method based on slender-body and strip theories was found to yield results in good agreement with the wind-tunnel measurements these comparisons indicate that the changes in the panel characteristics due to combined angles are caused primarily by a cross coupling between the side-wash velocities due to angle of attack and sideslip and by the presence of forebody vortices due to crossflow separation it was found that an increase in forebody length increases the effect of the forebody vortices because of the dependence of the strength of these vortices on the forebody length 
	-  	tunnel tests on a double cascade to determine the interaction between the rotor and the nozzles of a supersonic turbine stratford,b ngte m359 tunnel tests on a double cascade to determine the interaction between the rotor and the nozzles of a supersonic turbine experimental confirmation has been required that in a supersonic turbine the leading edges of the rotor governs the rotor incidence and, hence, the gas exit angle from the nozzles evidence has also been required that, once the rotor incidence has been allowed for, there is no adverse effect of the rotors on the nozzle flow, even when the rotors have a large turning angle the present test cascade represented the stationary configuration of a turbine of 2 nozzle mach number and 74 swirl angle, the rotors being designed to operate at 1 relative mach number and to provide a turning angle of 140 in the tests, fully supersonic flow could be established through the system, but the losses were fairly high and an increase in loss of about 25 per cent would have caused choking in the rotor 
	-  	local heat transfer and recovery temperature on a yawed cylinder at a mach number of 4 15 and high reynolds numbers beckwith,i and gallagher,j nasa memo 2-27-59l, 1959 local heat transfer and recovery temperature on a yawed cylinder at a mach number of 4 15 and high reynolds numbers local heat transfer, equilibrium temperatures, and wall static pressures have been measured on a circular cylinder at yaw angles of 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 the reynolds number range of the tests was from 1x10 to 4x10 based on cylinder diameter increasing the yaw angle from 0 to 40 increased the stagnation-line heat-transfer coefficients by 100 to 180 percent a further increase in yaw angle to heat-transfer coefficients at zero yaw angle the boundary layer over the entire front half of the cylinder was laminar but at yaw angles of 40 and 60 it was evidently completely turbulent, including the stagnation line, as determined by comparison of local heat-transfer coefficients with theoretical predictions the level of heating rates and the nature of the chordwise distribution of heat transfer indicated that a flow mechanism different from the conventional transitional boundary layer may have existed at the intermediate yaw angles of 10 and 20 at all yaw angles the peak heat-transfer coefficient occurred at the stagnation line and the chordwise distribution of heat-transfer coefficient decreased monotonically from this peak the average heat-transfer coefficients over the front half of the cylinder are in agreement with previous data for a comparable reynolds number range the theoretical heat-transfer distributions for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers are calculated directly from simple quadrature formulas derived in the present report 
	-  	investigation of full scale split trailing edge wing flaps with various chords and hinge locations wallace,r naca r 39, 1935 investigation of full scale split trailing edge wing flaps with various chords and hinge locations an investigation was conducted in the n a c a full-scale wind tunnel on a small parasol monoplane equipped with three different split trailing-edge wing flaps the object of the investigation was to determine and correlate data on the characteristics of the airplane and flaps as affected by variation in flap chord, flap deflection, and flap location along the wing chord the chords of the flaps were 10, 20, and 30 percent of the wing chord and each flap was tested at deflections from 0 to 75 when located successively at 68, 80, and 88 percent of the wing chord aft of the leading edge the investigation included force tests, pressure-distribution tests, and downwash surveys the results give the lift, the drag, and the pitching-moment characteristics of the airplane, the flap forces and moments, the pressure distribution over the flaps and wing at one section, and the downwash characteristics of the flap and wing combinations an increase in flap chord or distance of the flap from the leading edge of the wing increased the lift of the airplane but had an adverse effect on the wing pitching moment the ld ratio of the airplane decreased with increase in flap deflection or flap chord flap normal-force coefficients were primarily a function of flap deflection and were relatively independent of flap chord, hinge-axis location, and airplane attitude the location of the flap center of pressure in percentage of flap chord aft of the hinge axis remained practically constant irrespective of airplane attitude and of flap deflection, chord, or location flap hinge-moment coefficients varied with a power of flap chord greater than the square so that with regard to hinge moments narrow flaps were the most efficient in producing a given increase in lift split trailing-edge flaps materially affected the magnitude and distribution of pressures over the entire wing profile at low angles of attack the predominant effect of the flaps was to increase positively the lower-surface pressures , at high angles of attack, to increase negatively the upper-surface pressures downwash surveys indicated that horizontal tail planes located above the wing chord line would be more effective than those below the chord in counteracting the increased diving moment of the airplane with flaps deflected 
	-  	low-speed longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of low-aspect ratio wings having variations in leading-edge contour spencer, b and hammond, a nasa tn d-1374, 1962 low-speed longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of low-aspect ratio wings having variations in leading-edge contour an investigation has been conducted at various reynolds numbers and low subsonic speeds to determine the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics associated with a series of low-aspect-ratio wings having variations in leading-edge contours the planforms included a highly swept triangular wing, a rectangular wing, and intermediate wings including planforms having elliptic and parabolic leading-edge contours, all having an aspect ratio of 1 3 the effects of changing aspect ratio for a given leading-edge contour were investigated for two of the wings presented, also included are the longitudinal characteristics associated with various fuselage sizes an effort has been made to estimate the lift variation with angle of attack for the wing planforms of the present investigation improvements in the lifting capabilities at low subsonic speeds associated with a basic triangular planform of low aspect ratio are possible by slight alterations in leading-edge design, which should still conform to possible design requirements at hypersonic speeds these changes in planform resulted in increases in lift-curve slope, lift at high angles of attack, and in the maximum untrimmed lift-drag ratio, provided the fuselage was sufficiently small the longitudinal stability characteristics of the majority of planforms indicate more desirable stability characteristics at high lifts than either a triangular wing or rectangular wing of the same aspect ratio the effects of increasing reynolds number for each of the planforms investigated generally resulted in slight reductions in the lift at high angles of attack a method is presented for estimating the subsonic-lift variation with angle of attack for the low-aspect-ratio wings of the present investigation and indicated good agreement with experimental data throughout the angle-of-attack range of this investigation 
	-  	investigation of several blunt bodies to determine trans- onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects of spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and some measurements of unsteady base pressures fisher,l and dicamillo,j nasa memo 1-21-59l, 1959 investigation of several blunt bodies to determine trans- onic aerodynamic characteristics including effects of spinning and of extendible afterbody flaps and some measurements of unsteady base pressures several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for atmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34 the tests were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds numbers from 1 4 x 10 to 2 8 x 10, based on body diameter a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve slopes the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears to be subject to mach number effects spinning a full-skirted body about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static stability parameter through the transonic mach number range the extension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of a short-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability only if the flaps extended into the airstream some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two dissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach number in these tests there is doubt, however, that these pressures can induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehicle because of their small amplitude and phasing 
	-  	long slender delta wings with leading edge separation brown,c and michael,w naca tn 430 long slender delta wings with leading edge separation the slender-body approximation of linearized compressible flow is applied to the problem of a delta wing in which flow separation occurs at the leading edges the vortex sheets found in the real flow are approximated by concentrated vortices with feeding lattices, and a plausible adaptation of kelvin's theorem is applied to simulate the force-free nature of the vortex sheet the computations show that leading-edge separation produces an increase in lift over that given by the jones slender-wing theory and that the lift does not vary linearly with angle of attack computed pressure distributions and span loadings are presented and the theoretical lift results are compared with the results of simple force tests made at a mach number of 1 
	-  	exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach number 6 free stream romeo,d and sterrett,j nasa tn 1605, 1963 exploratory investigation of the effect of a forward facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach number 6 free stream the effect of a forward-facing jet on the bow shock of a blunt body in a mach 6 free stream was investigated experimentally the models tested had forward-facing jets using air and helium exhausting at mach numbers from 1 to 10 and were run through a range of the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream total pressure of 0 3 (jet off) to 2 the ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter varied from 1 2 to 55 and the angle of attack was varied from 0 to 35 the experimental results show that the main-stream shock can be affected by the jet in two significantly different ways one way is simply to move the strong shock away from the body without altering its shape the second and perhaps more interesting case occurs when the jet causes a large displacement of the main shock and considerably changes its shape it was found that the ratio of jet total pressure to free-stream total pressure necessary to obtain the large displacements of the main-stream shock depended on the ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter and also on the jet-exit mach number the maximum amount the shock could be displaced in percent of body diameter was seen to increase with increasing jet-exit mach number and also with decreasing ratio of body diameter to jet-exit diameter for the models that were investigated through an angle-of-attack range, the displacement became very unsteady and fell off sharply as the angle of attack was increased simplified theoretical considerations applied to the shock-displacement phenomena provide a possible explanation for the two different types of main-stream shock displacement theoretical curves show the regions where these types of displacement would occur for different exit mach numbers and pressure ratios for a forward-facing jet in a mach 6 stream 
	- 0 	on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells experimental measurements of pressures and heat-transfer rates over three blunt afterbodies of small fineness ratio in fully separated wakes are presented the afterbodies are generally similar in shape but have different stepdown heights from the end of the forebody tests were made by means of a new shroud technique over a range of reynolds numbers closely corresponding to typical flight conditions at mach numbers on the order of 20, considering models on the order of 5 ft in diameter at about 120,000 ft altitude stagnation temperatures on the order of 1,300 r to strictly speaking, the test flows correspond to prototype flows which would be created by a forebody consisting of a sharp or slightly blunted 54 half angle cone which turns cylindrical for a short distance and then connects with the afterbody judiciously interpreted, the results may be considered to have a somewhat wider applicability for approximation purposes the results are presented and compared with each other in terms of nondimensional variables based on flow conditions at the end of the forebody the pressure distribution along an afterbody is seen to be roughly uniform in each run for a given point on an afterbody, the ratio of pressure to the stagnation pressure at the forebody end (or exit) decreases with increasing stagnation pressure or reynolds number the present pressures and pressure-reynolds number variations (fig 8) are compared with values obtained from chapman's mach 2 or 3 base-pressure data, qualitative and some quantitative agreement is noted in the reynolds number range comparable to those of the present tests, chapman's exit boundary layers were considered to be laminar an approximate check of the heat-transfer rate at the forebody end in the present tests also indicates a laminar rate no information was obtained concerning the possible transition of the free-mixing separated boundary layer covering the wake an adverse pressure gradient on the cylindrical end of the forebody figs 7(a) and 7(c) was observed heat-transfer rates are seen to be roughly uniform over an afterbody in each run, although some increase in the streamwise direction is noted the afterbody nusselt number (n) varies with the reynolds number (r evaluated at the forebody end) roughly in the manner n r where generally (fig 13) heat rates on the rear faces of the afterbodies are almost twice the values on the sides the heat rates on the large-step body are higher than those on the body of zero stepdown height in an addendum, it is shown that the prandtl-meyer expansion angle of the flow leaving the afterbody increases with increasing test reynolds number, and that the corresponding local mach number square increases linearly with reynolds number the effect is to keep the local wake reynolds numbers virtually constant with increasing test reynolds number while the afterbody heat rates increase sharply the expansion angle on the afterbody of zero stepdown height is significantly smaller than on the stepped down bodies, this may affect the decreased heat rates on this body 
	- 4 	aerodynamic heating of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 stoney, w naca rm l58 e05a, 1958 aerodynamic heating of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 results are presented from recent investigations of the aerodynamic heating rates of blunt nose shapes at mach numbers up to 14 data obtained in flight and wind-tunnel tests have shown that the flat-faced cylinder has about 50 percent the stagnation-point heating rates of the hemisphere over nearly the entire mach number range tests made at a mach number of 2 on a series of bodies made up of hemispherical segments of varying radius of curvature showed that slight amounts of curvature can decrease the local rates at the edge of the flat-faced cylinders with only a slight increase in the stagnation rate the total heat transfer to such slightly curved bodies is also somewhat smaller than the total heat transfer to flat-faced cylinders comparison of several tests with theoretical heating-rate distributions showed that both laminar and turbulent local rates can be predicted by available theories /given the pressure distribution about the body/ reasonably well, although the scatter of the available data still leaves open the choice between the theories at the edge of the bodies, where they usually differ tests on a flat-faced cylinder at a mach number of 2 9 and at angles of attack up to 15degree showed the movement of the apparent stagnation point from the center of the body to the 50 percent windward station at creased about 30 percent while that near the leeward edge decreased about 20 percent at 15degree angle of attack preliminary results on a concave nose have indicated the possibility that this type of design may be developed to give heating rates significantly lower than even the flat-faced cylinder rates the test results have also shown, however, the existence of an unsteady flow phenomenon which can increase the heating rates to extremely high values 
	- 4 	steady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speeds on two space-vehicle payload shapes coe,c nasa tm 503, 1961 steady and fluctuating pressures at transonic speeds on two space-vehicle payload shapes steady and fluctuating pressures have been measured at mach numbers which were varied from 0 to 1 on two bodies of revolution typical of two space-vehicle payload shapes, the centaur and the able v the results of the investigation showed that significant fluctuations of pressure occurred on both bodies between mach numbers of 0 5 and 1 0 the maximum fluctuations measured at any mach number and angle of attack occurred in the region of the normal shock wave as a result of shock-wave motion large regions of unsteady pressure also occurred as a result of separation on the converging afterbody of the able-v model the maximum pressure fluctuations occurring on the bodies increased with increasing angle of attack for angles other than are indicated since pressure fluctuations were larger on the upper half of the bodies than on the lower half no definite conclusions could be drawn regarding the form of the spectral densities of pressure fluctuations in the region of the shock wave the spectral densities in regions of separation following the shock wave appeared flat except for some increase in energy level below due to slight model motions 
	- 4 	effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics of a four- engined vertical take-off and landing transport airplane model with tilting wing and propellers newson,w naca tn 124, 1957 effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics of a four- engined vertical take-off and landing transport airplane model with tilting wing and propellers an investigation has been made to study the effect of ground proximity on the aerodynamic characteristics of a four-engine vertical- take-off-and-landing transport-airplane model with tilting wing and propellers tests were made with the wing at an angle of incidence of 90, the position used for vertical take-off or landing with the model at various heights above the ground, the lift, drag, and pitching moment were measured and tuft studies were made to determine the flow field caused by the propeller slipstream data were obtained for the complete model, for the model with horizontal tail removed, and for the wing-propeller combination alone the results of the investigation showed that, when the model was hovering near the ground, there was a strong upwash in the plane of symmetry and also an increase in lift of about 10 percent of the propeller thrust about one-half of this lift resulted from an increase in propeller thrust and one-half resulted from an up load on the fuselage induced by the upwash as the model approached the ground, it also experienced an increasing nose-down pitching moment that evidently resulted from the up load on the fuselage, the rear part of which was longer than the front part the addition of the horizontal tail which was located about halfway up the vertical tail did not increase the nose-down pitching moment because the fuselage decreased the energy of the upwash before it reached the tail

	-  	an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter in real fluids chu,w and abramson,h j ae scs 26, 1959 an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter in real fluids it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow theory, even at small angles of attack as the stall angle is approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus deviates even more from the theoretical value pinkerton employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the flow pattern practically, this is accomplished by giving a fictitious camber to the profile since potential flow theory is valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate source distributions the boundary layer cannot be evaluated, of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is applied a criterion to determine the circulation, by generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge shall have the same value when determined from the potential-flow values above and below the airfoil this procedure gives qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady flow

	- 4 	note on creep buckling of columns note on creep buckling of columns the general dynamic equation of creep bending of a beam loaded laterally and axially was derived for a linearly viscoelastic material whose mechanical properties can be characterized by four parameters the material can exhibit instantaneous and retarded elasticity as well as pure flow the equation derived was used to obtain the creep bending deflection of a beam in pure bending and of a column with initial sinusoidal deviation from straightness as expected, the ratio of the creep deflections of the beam in pure bending and the deflections of a corresponding purely elastic structure is identical to the ratio of the creep strain and the corresponding elastic strain of a bar under simple tension or compression the results of the analysis of the creep deflection of the column showed that the deflections increase continuously with time and become infinitely large only when the loading time is correspondingly large however, large deflections are obtained in reasonably short periods of time if the applied load is near to the euler load of the column the deflection-time curves obtained from a numerical example are of the same type as those determined by experiment with aluminum columns

	- 1 	atmosphere entries with spacecraft lift-drag ratios modulated to limit decelerations levy,l nasa tn 1427, 1962 atmosphere entries with spacecraft lift-drag ratios modulated to limit decelerations an analysis has been made of atmosphere entries for which the spacecraft lift-drag ratios were modulated to limit the maximum deceleration the parts of the drag polars used during modulation were from maximum lift coefficient to minimum drag coefficient five drag polars of different shapes were assumed for the spacecraft the entries covered wide ranges of initial velocity, initial flight-path angle, initial and maximum lift-drag ratio two-dimensional trajectory calculations were made for a nonrotating, spherical earth with an exponential atmosphere the results of the analysis indicate for four of the five drag polars that, relative to the maximum deceleration of an unmodulated entry at maximum lift-drag ratio, the greatest reduction in maximum deceleration obtainable by modulation depends upon a single parameter this parameter is the ratio of the value of the aerodynamic resultant-force coefficient at minimum drag coefficient to the value at maximum lift coefficient thus, the reduction in maximum deceleration is independent of initial velocity, initial flight-path angle, initial maximum lift-drag ratio, and the shape of the drag polar for the fifth drag polar, the reduction in maximum deceleration was found to depend upon the maximum lift-drag ratio also, relative to the depth of a given deceleration-limited corridor, the greatest increase in corridor depth obtainable by modulation (for four of the five drag polars) depends upon the same ratio of aerodynamic resultant-force coefficients the fractional increase in corridor depth can be expressed as an empirically determined analytical function of this ratio 
	- 3 	on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel holder, d and schultz, d arc r + m 3265, august 1960 on the flow in a reflected shock tunnel the performance of a shock tunnel operated by the reflected-shock technique is examined theoretically neglecting viscous effects and high-temperature real-gas effects particular attention is given to disturbances to the flow at the nozzle entry caused by waves reflected from the contact surface when the operating conditions depart from those for that the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is weak enough to be tolerated only within a small range of primary-shock mach number, m /e 5 7 m 6 3 if the pressure at entry to the nozzle is to remain constant to 10 per cent/ within this range, running times much longer than those obtained in 'straight-through' shock tunnels are predicted, the limitation usually being imposed by the arrival of the expansion wave originating at the diaphragm outside this range of mach number, the uniform-flow duration between the arrival at the nozzle entry of the primary shock and the first disturbance reflected from the contact surface is shown to be approximately equal to the time between the arrival of the primary shock and the contact surface in a 'straight-through' shock tunnel at first sight it appears, therefore, that the advantages of reflected-shock operation are confined to a very narrow range of shock mach number, unless a heated driver gas is used in order to vary the mach number for further analysis suggests, however, that subsequent disturbances in the multiple wave reflection process between the contact surface and the end of the tube are relatively weak over a useful range of shock mach number thus, if the flow after the arrival of the early reflected disturbances is used for test purposes, long running times seem possible in theory without severe restrictions to the shock mach number experiments have been made in a shock tube and a shock tunnel to provide data for comparisons with the results of the simple theory if allowance is made for viscous effects on the motion of the contact surface, fair agreement is found for the disturbances reflected and transmitted by the contact surface, and for the arrival of the expansion wave reflection process increases when the shock mach number is raised substantially above the 'tailored' value, and a limit to the usable flow duration may result a striking feature of the results is a fall of pressure at the end of the tube immediately after reflection of the primary shock this is attributed to attenuation of the reflected shock resulting from its interaction with the boundary layer on the wall of the tube further research is required to check this explanation, and to investigate the effects of reynolds number and of the cross-sectional shape and size of the tube the effects of the tail and reflected head of the expansion wave originating at the main diaphragm are discussed it is shown that the arrival of the reflected head at the nozzle entry may impose a severe limitation to the duration of uniform conditions at low shock mach number, and that the arrival of the tail may limit the flow duration at high shock mach number unless means can be devised to suppress the expansion wave, it is demonstrated that it is desirable to have alternative diaphragm positions in a tube required to operate over a range of shock mach number it is concluded that running times of order 10 milliseconds at a shock mach number of 4, falling to, perhaps, 1 millisecond at a shock mach number of 8 seem possible in a shock tunnel of reasonable size by using reflected-shock operation with unheated hydrogen driving air because of the simplifying assumptions of the theoretical investigations, and the deficiencies of the apparatus used for the experiments, the present investigation must, however, be regarded as preliminary in character further research is required to check and extend the findings, and topics particularly requiring investigation are listed in the paper

	- 	an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure field charwat,a j ae scs 28, 1961, 457 an investigation of separated flows, part i: the pressure field the present article describes an investigation of several types of separated regions such as blunt-base wakes and cavities formed in cutouts in the boundaries and ahead of or behind two dimensional steps in supersonic (mach numbers 2 to 4) and subsonic flow the conditions for the existence, the geometry, and the pressure field are described in this paper a second article (to be published) will describe investigations of the internal flow and the heat transfer across such separated regions it is found that there is a maximum (critical) ratio of the length of the separated free-shear layer to the depth of the depression in the boundary beyond which the cavity collapses, leaving mutually independent separated regions at each protrusion this critical length changes greatly upon laminar-turbulent transition in the oncoming boundary layer, in either laminar or turbulent flow it is approximately independent of mach and reynolds numbers a semiempirical correlation predicting the conditions under which the flow will span a depression of arbitrary depth is proposed detailed pressure distributions along the boundaries of a cavity (in turbulent flow) are presented as a function of the ratio of the cavity length to the critical length, which is found to be the pertinent similarity parameter for short notches the impact pressure due to the reversal of the inner portion of the shear layer at recompression tends to thicken the shear layer and a type of boundary layer-free stream interaction governs the pressure field the pressure in the cavity is nearly constant and can be higher than free-stream in long notches the shear layer bends inward at separation and curves back gradually ahead of the recompression point the floor-pressure variation is pronounced and the recovery pressure at reattachment is small the variation of the drag coefficient with mach number reflects the change from one to the other mechanism of recompression detailed surveys of the mach-number distributions in a blunt-body wake and the mixing region behind its throat, as well as in the shear layer spanning a cutout in a wall, are presented and analyzed it is found that, in general, the assumptions of the simple supersonic-wake models which rely on a principle of steady flow with mass conservation in the cavity are not adequate for cavities in which there is recompression against a boundary results showing the influence of the thickness of the initial boundary layer (in the range of 0 to 3 times the notch depth) and of the geometry of the notch are also presented 
	-  	a note on application of transonic linearization to an airfoil with a round leading edge hosokawa,i j ae scs 29, 1962, 1395 a note on application of transonic linearization to an airfoil with a round leading edge the profile of a symmetric airfoil of unit length with a round leading edge can be expressed, in general, as where p(x) has a finite slope at x = 0 it is well known that the conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories of compressible flow break down in the neighborhood of such a round leading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbance assumption the linearized transonic flow theory has the same short-coming, but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoil plays an important role in any more advanced theory--e spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method of refinement--this theoretical barrier will become more serious because the sonic point is usually located in a flow region near the leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness 
	-  	heat transfer to separated and reattached subsonic turbulen flows obtained downstream of a surface step seban,r emery,a and levy,a j ae scs 1959, 809 heat transfer to separated and reattached subsonic turbulen flows obtained downstream of a surface step local heat-transfer coefficients and recovery factors are presented for separated and reattached turbulent flows as obtained by a downward step in an otherwise flat surface in a two- dimensional, subsonic, air flow the region downstream of the step, the focus of this investigation, contained a region of separated flow with reattachment at about five step heights downstream, followed by a section of reattached flow the salient feature of the results is the maximum in the local heat-transfer coefficient at the reattachment point, with values thereof diminishing in the separated region and also in the reattached region, where they tend toward values characteristic of turbulent boundary-layer flow it is found that for most of the region the heat-transfer coefficient depends on the velocity to about the 0 power, though a decreased dependence may exist in the separated region recovery factors have the characteristically low values associated with separated flows, and do not attain values typical of turbulent boundary-layer flows within the downstream lengths available 
	-  	heat transfer through laminar boundary layers on semi-infinite cylinders of arbitrary cross section bourne,d and wardle,s j ae scs 29, 1962, 460 heat transfer through laminar boundary layers on semi-infinite cylinders of arbitrary cross section this paper shows how to calculate the rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on a semi-infinite cylinder of arbitrary cross section the cylinder is placed in a stream of incompressible fluid, the flow at infinity being parallel to the generators, and is maintained at a uniform temperature a series solution for small downstream distances and an asymptotic formula for large downstream distances are given to cover the intermediate range an approximate pohlhausen solution is obtained, a correction of the error involved in the pohlhausen solution is suggested which, it is believed, will lead to final errors of at most 2 percent the calculations are applied to elliptic cylinders, and illustrate the effect on the local rate of heat transfer of varying the ratio of the major and minor axes of cross section, the length of perimeter being held fixed

	- 9 	plastic stability theory of thin shells gerard,g j ae scs 24, 1957 plastic stability theory of thin shells considerable interest is currently centered on the role of deformation and flow types of plasticity theories in the solution of stability problems for thin flat plates, deformation theory combined with classical stability theory appears to yield results which are in substantially good agreement with test data on the other hand, flow or incremental theories appear to require the introduction of initial imperfections in order to obtain a satisfactory degree of correlation with tests thus, in view of the current state of development of plastic stability theory, it appears fruitful to exploit the mathematical simplicity inherent in deformation theory in the investigation of the plastic stability of thin shells although there may be theoretical objections to deformation theories as a class, test data on flat plates do suggest the predictive value of the results obtained from this theory in this paper, a set of equilibrium differential equations for the plastic buckling of thin shells of constant unequal radii is derived this set of three equations applies to flat plates, cylinders, and spheres under any loading system leading to buckling for particular problems such as buckling of cylinders under axial compression, torsion or lateral pressure, and spheres under external pressure, the set of equations can be reduced to a single eighth-order partial differential equation of the donnell type in terms of the radial displacement only these donnell-type equations are used to obtain solutions for plastic buckling of spheres under external pressure and long and moderate length cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion loads the limiting cases of a simply supported flat plate under compression or shear, represent the solutions for short cylinders under lateral pressure or torsion, respectively 
	- 9 	body under lifting wing chen,c and clarke,j j ae scs 1961, 547 body under lifting wing an investigation is made of supersonic-aircraft configurations composed of a cambered body positioned a certain distance beneath an arbitrary lifting wing the geometry of the wing is regarded as given and the geometry of the body may be given or optimum expressions for the drag and lift are obtained from reverse-flow considerations, these greatly implement such a study when interference cross flows must be cancelled the drag advantage to be gained when a given body and wing assume a given orientation is studied treated more extensively is the variational problem of determining the optimum wing incidence and optimum body shape, for the given volume and length, to yield the minimum drag for prescribed lift numerical results are provided to indicate the significance of the large number of parameters appearing in the problem of these, the gap between the wing and the body is found to be particularly important it is found that at low gap moderate body distortions have a significant influence on the drag drag reductions of up to 44 relative to the case of no interference have been found at a mach number of 2 4 in a configuration having a gap approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the body, and a wing chord of about three eighths of the length of the body comparison is made with the conventional wing-body combination including the effects of skin friction, and it is concluded that the advantage suggested by the preceding considerations is not appreciably diminished finally, it is shown that the configurations studied lead to bodies of fineness ratios much lower than are appropriate to conventional wing-body combinations tests were made on an arrangement consisting of a scars-haack body located under a lifting rectangular diamond-profile wing the mach number was 1 and the reynolds number was 9 7 x 10 based on the body length it was found that the measured lift developed on the wing due to the flow field of the body agrees very well with the theoretical value downstream of the impinging shock from the wing, flow separation was observed on the exterior of the body but not in the interior the separation is attributed not to the pressure rise across the shock but to the pressure field arising from the reflection from the body of the shock-induced cross flow further observations suggest that the separation can be avoided by pitching the body or by kinking the body at the shock wave to accommodate the shock-induced cross flow

	- 2 	compressible flat-plate boundary-layer flow with an applied magnetic field bush,w j ae scs 1960, 49 compressible flat-plate boundary-layer flow with an applied magnetic field the laminar boundary-layer equations are formulated and solved for a flat plate in high-speed compressible air flow where equilibrium dissociation and ionization are assumed and where there is an applied magnetic field having its component normal to the plate proportional to the skin-friction and heat-transfer characteristics are determined for free-stream velocities of up to 17,500 meters sec and magnetic fields of up to about the results show that the skin friction and heat transfer at a given free-stream velocity decrease with increasing magnetic field strength, and the percentage reduction is constant along the length of the plate they also exhibit the same hysteresis behavior as was first found in the case of magnetoaerodynamic couette flow, however, for the flat plate the hysteresis effect disappears at a higher mach number furthermore, it was found that the reduction in heat transfer with increasing field strength is opposite in behavior from that for couette flow

	- 	on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface sinnott,c j e cs 26, 1959, 169 on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream indicates the important factors determining the pressure distribution on the airfoil analysis of the mach wave pattern suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoil surface slope the compressive effect of the reflected mach waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributions for uncambered airfoils, and it is shown how this can be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good agreement with experiment

	-  	thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustaining nose shapes at hypersonic speeds hanawalt, a blessing, a and schmidt, c j ero sc may 1959 p 257-263 thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustaining nose shapes at hypersonic speeds the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected to severe aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e internal convection, transpiration, or radiation it is this latter mode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paper neglecting conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature for long-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting point of refractory materials, with a corresponding large temperature gradient away from the leading edge inclusion of conduction in the aft direction reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat to a location that will radiate it out from the surface for either steady-state or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge is reduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edge shoulder is increased, thus setting up a heat transmission balance between the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat by conduction, and the radiation of heat from the surface the feasibility of such a mechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edge shapes and materials the philosophy behind the choice of leading-edge shapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such as shape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc are shown

	-  	a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic speeds eggers, a syvertson, c and krqus, s naca report 1123 a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic speeds steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is investigated analyticially with the assumption that air behaves as a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock detachment this result applies not only to the determination of the surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the whole flow field about an airfoil verification of this observation is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure distribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of attack an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 this slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may prove useful for some engineering purposes effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed flow fields at high mach numbers are investigated, particular attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific heats so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially as accurate as for ideal-gas flows this observation is verfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a generalized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average value of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may approach close to 1 in this case, it is found that the shock-expansion method may be in considerable error, however, the busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach number and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply with reasonable accuracy

	- 1 	a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions uram,e j ae scs 1960, 659 a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulent boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed which permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general character of the boundary layer the method offers the simplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled differential equations required by existing methods the method also affords, for the first time, a means of determining the total boundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as well as the nondimensional velocity distribution the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two regions--an inner region which is described by the law of the wall and an outer region which is described by a function depicting the deviation from that law the deviation function involves two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the skin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practical purposes, can be considered a constant since the entire velocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the generally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream conditions agreement between experimental velocity distributions and those calculated by the method presented here is generally very good the analysis and calculation procedures which are presented are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two- dimensional, and axisymmetric conical flows

	-  	the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression von karman,t and tsien,h j ae scs 8, 1941, 303 the buckling of thin cylindrical shells under axial compression in two previous papers the authors have discussed in detail the inadequacy of the classical theory of thin shells in explaining the buckling phenomenon of cylindrical and spherical shells it was shown that not only the calculated buckling load is 3 to 5 times higher than that found by experiments, but the observed wave pattern of the buckled shell is also different from that predicted furthermore, it was pointed out that the different explanations for this discrepancy advanced by l h donnell and w flugge are untenable when certain conclusions drawn from these explanations are compared with the experimental facts by a theoretical investigation on spherical shells the authors were led to the belief that in general the buckling phenomenon of curved shells can only be explained by means of a non-linear large deflection theory this point of view was substantiated by model experiments on slender columns with non-linear elastic support the non-linear characteristics of such structures cause the load necessary to keep the shell in equilibrium to drop very rapidly with increase in wave amplitude once the structure started to buckle thus, first of all, a part of the elastic energy stored in the shell is released once the buckling has started, this explains the observed rapidity of the buckling process furthermore, as it was shown in one of the previous papers the buckling load itself can be materially reduced by slight imperfections in the test specimen and vibrations during the testing process in this paper, the same ideas are applied to the case of a thin uniform cylindrical shell under axial compression first it is shown by an approximate calculation that again the load sustained by the shell drops with increasing deflection then the results of this calculation are used for a more detailed discussion of the buckling process as observed in an actual testing machine

	-  	concerning the effect of compressibility on laminar boundary layers and their separation howarth,l proc roy soc a, 194, 1948 concerning the effect of compressibility on laminar boundary layers and their separation the theory of compressible flow in a laminar boundary layer has been developed for the case when the viscosity is assumed to be proportional to the absolute temperature and the prandtl number is unity (these assumptions may be compared with the empirical relations suggested by cope it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate normal to the layer can lead to a simplified form of equation of motion very similar to the ordinary incompressible equation but modified by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure term this factor is greater than unity at the boundary and tends to one at the outside of the layer several particular solutions are considered including accelerated flow with a linearly increasing velocity and retarded flow along a flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity the general implications of the theory are discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn when the mainstream velocity starts from a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and subsequently falls it is concluded that for such a velocity distribution increasing compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase the boundary layer thickness and cause earlier separation as compared with the incompressible flow with the same mainstream velocity distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding to conditions at the stagnation point

	- 	on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying through the atmosphere feldman,s j ae scs 28, 1961, 433 on trails of axisymmetric hypersonic blunt bodies flying through the atmosphere the trail left in the atmosphere by a body moving at hypersonic speeds is the subject of theoretical treatment the times required for ionization and dissociation (and their inverse processes) to go to completion, when compared to the flow times of a gas particle, are important in determining the observable effects of hypersonic trails-i emitted thermal radiation and reflection of electromagnetic waves from the trail in order to simplify the theoretical treatment, the trail is divided into two regions (1) the expansion-controlled trail, which treats the behavior of the wake behind the body up to a point, along the direction of flight, where the pressure decays to the free-stream value and cooling is controlled principally by the expansion of the flow, and (2) the conduction-controlled trail, where the trail cools mainly by diffusion of heat away from the high-temperature core the influence of the details of the body shape on the observables are discussed and a simple computational procedure for the behavior of the conduction-controlled trail is developed based on integral methods results of calculations that assume thermodynamic equilibrium of the flow field give the values of the thermodynamic variables in the trail of a sphere, axial distributions of emitted thermal radiation, and maps of electron density distribution it is shown that the cooling of the conduction-controlled trail is essentially due to conduction of heat and that viscous effects are not important it is found that this portion of the trail does not widen as one proceeds downstream flight velocities considered vary between 15,000 and 35,000 ft sec and altitudes range between 100,000 and 250,000 ft

	- 2 	on axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presence of initial boundary layer gdalia kleinstein polytechnic institute of brooklyn, farmingdale, n on axially symmetric, turbulent, compressible mixing in the presence of initial boundary layer recent experimental results have shown that the mixing of heterogeneous gases having an initial velocity ratio close to unity occurs faster than is predicted by classical eddy-viscosity theory the theoretical analysis of two uniform streams of different gases but of nearly equal velocity, performed with the usual assumptions for eddy viscosity and prandtl number equal to a constant, shows that mixing will take place very slowly, i at the rate corresponding to laminar diffusion it has been suggested that the difference between analysis and experiment could be attributed to the presence of a boundary layer in the experiments it is the purpose of this note to show that the use of the classical eddy-viscosity law, admitting the existence of a boundary layer, is not sufficient to explain the rapid mixing that is observed physically instead, it is shown that rapid mixing can be explained on the basis of a different eddy-viscosity law, as was suggested in ref 1 these conclusions are obtained through application of the analysis presented briefly below
